    description: 'This was a project to test our ability to display random images, keep track of what images were shown and how many times they were clicked, and chart the results. We also had to use local storage to store the results and use animation to add attractiveness to the page...

    We're fallin' through space, you and me, clinging to the skin of this tiny little world, and if we let go... Lots of planets have a North. Rose... before I go, I just want to tell you: you were fantastic. Absolutely fantastic. And do you know what? So was I! Your wish is my command. But be careful what you wish for. Fantastic! Yeah, I came first in jiggery pokery, what about you? And I'm looking for a blonde in a Union Jack. A specific one, mind, I didn't just wake up this morning with a craving.

    The trouble with computers, of course, is that they're very sophisticated idiots. They do exactly what you tell them at amazing speed. Even if you order them to kill you. So if you do happen to change your mind, it's very difficult to stop them from obeying the original order. But not impossible. Come on! Would you like a jelly baby? What?! Come out. And don't touch anything! You're standing on my scarf. Well, of course I'm being childish! There's no point being grown-up if you can't be childish sometimes.'

    Run. One day, just one day, maybe I'll meet somebody who gets the whole 'don't wander off' thing. Your wish is my command. But be careful what you wish for. The past is another country. 1987's just the Isle of Wight. And I'm looking for a blonde in a Union Jack. A specific one, mind, I didn't just wake up this morning with a craving. An old friend of mine. Well, enemy. The stuff of nightmares reduced to an exhibit. I'm getting old. We're fallin' through space, you and me, clinging to the skin of this tiny little world, and if we let go...</p>
    <p>Nine hundred years of time and space, and I've never been slapped by someone's mother. Excuse me, do you mind not farting while I'm saving the world? Yeah, I came first in jiggery pokery, what about you? You look beautiful! ...considering. That you're human. One day, just one day, maybe I'll meet somebody who gets the whole 'don't wander off' thing. Lots of planets have a North. Run. An old friend of mine. Well, enemy. The stuff of nightmares reduced to an exhibit. I'm getting old. I think you need a doctor.

    description: 'This project...Don't you think she looks tired? It is! It's the city of New New York! Strictly speaking, it's the fifteenth New York since the original, so that makes it New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New New York. Yeah? Well I'm the Lord of Time. You can spend the rest of your life with me, but I can't spend the rest of mine with you. I have to live on. Alone. That's the curse of the Time Lords. There's something else I've always wanted to say: Allons-y, Alonso! What? What?! WHAT?! I'll tell you what, then: don't...step on any butterflies. What have butterflies ever done to you?

    Sorry, I'm going to have to relieve you of your pet. Shut up, I was talking to the horse. Your hips are fine, you're built like a man! Big scarf, bow tie, big embarrassing. When this is all over, you can find a shoulder to cry on. But for now, you need me. I am totally against bantering. No sir. Thirteen! Don't be lasagna. He was dead already, I'm saving us. Follow me, and run! Well, I would say that that person would be an egomaniac, need, game-player sort of person. I don't need a sword. Because I'm the Doctor ... and this is my spoon.

    I'll tell you what, then: don't...step on any butterflies. What have butterflies ever done to you? People assume that time is a strict progression of cause-and-effect... but actually, from a non-linear, non-subjective viewpoint, it's more like a big ball of wibbly-wobbly... timey-wimey... stuff. I don't want to go. What? What?! WHAT?! I'm Dr. James McCrimmon from the township of Balamory. I'm the Doctor, I can save the world with a kettle and some string! And look! I'm wearing a vegetable! Please, when Torchwood comes to write my complete history, don't tell people I travelled through time and space with her mother!

    I just have one questionâ€¦ do you know how to fly this thing? These are attack eyebrows. You could take bottle tops off with these. I don't think that I'm a hugging person now. You see when I started, all those years ago, I was just running. I called myself the Doctor but it was just a name. Then I went to Skaro. And I met you lot. And I understood who I was. Shut up! Just shut up, shut up, shut up, shuttity up up up! It's all right up to the eyebrows. Then it goes haywire. When this is all over, you can find a shoulder to cry on. But for now, you need me.'
